            Problem Solving and Pseudocode (+ others)
        </h1>
        <p>
            One time I got stuck on a simple problem was the deBee inbuilt functions challenge, It really proved a little tricky for me as I couldn’t figure out how to get rid of the word bee when there were capitals within the word. After a little fussing around I took to Mr Google to give me a hand and quickly realized that I what I was doing was using === which means it has to be an exact match to what you are searching. So what I thought was something rally tricky actually just turned out to be me needing to press one more key and I would have had the right answer!

            A time I solved a problem elegantly was during the fizzbuzz challenge. Im starting to find a pattern here with my problem solving techniques but I took to the internet again and found a couple of really good videos on the basic fizzbuzz challenge that interviews ask sometimes. These videos really helped me undertnad the basics behind what was happening in the kata behind the scenes and led to a solution I was quite happy with.

        <h3>
            Pseudocode
        </h3>
        <p>
            Is a coding specific problem-solving technique that really helps lay everything that you need to do before you get into the nitty gritty coding side of it all. This is done using comments in plain English to explain what your code is going to need to do before writing the functioning code that you need. Because it is plain English guidelines of what you are going to need to do and not code is doesn’t need to be super in depth and functioning, Pseudocode acts as a great way to get onto paper what you need to do and get an idea of the projects flow without having to get into that projects underlying details.

        <h3>
            The rubber ducky method
        </h3>
        <p>
            Or the longer more technical term the rubber duck debugging method is another very useful way to problem solve while coding. The term rubber ducking became popular from a book about a programmer that carried around a duck all the time and had to explain each line of his code to the duck as if it could understand plain English. Now you don’t actually need a rubber duck to do this, any inanimate object will do but for best results use another person. Explaining what your code does out loud is going to help you understand what’s happening and in turn what’s going wrong in your code, if you have someone else that you are explaining it to then you are going to understand what is going on even better.

        <h3>
            Reading error messages and Console.loggin
        </h3>
        <p>
            Although not the same things they do coincide a little bit as console.logging helps keep track of where you are up to, what is assigned to what and what you code is doing along with really helping in showing what are causing the error messages to show up. Error messages are sometime a little bit like a guide on what is going wrong or at least help you locate where it is going wrong. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Googling 
        </h3>
        <p>
            The name kind of just says it all but this tends to the problem-solving method I rely on the most and have the most success with. There a million of people that have gone down this path before me and a lot of those people really enjoy making guides and videos that help make that journey easier for other people. There is so much information out there and if you are facing a problem in your code, likelihood is that someone else has experienced that same issue before, made a post on a forum about it and then 50 people have replied to his answer with different solutions to the issue with very detailed descriptions about what there solutions do.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Asking for help 
        </h3>
        <p>
            Be that from your peers or your coaches, they have a lot of information in those heads of theirs and it would be silly of us not to utilise it. We have slack and all the channels on there for this purpose specifically.
