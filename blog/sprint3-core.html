            What is Emotional Intelligence?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Emotional Intelligence (EI) by its Oxford dictonary definition is defined as “the capacity to be aware of, 
            control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.”
             In more layman terms it is the ability to understand, control and use your emotions in a way that positively
              impact your life. It is said that EI has five main components these being.
        </p>
        <p>
            Self-awareness: Being self-aware can help as it can make you aware to your strengths and weaknesses in everyday
             life as well as making you more understanding to others and their situations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Self-regulation: Is the act of staying in control. This could be either what you say, how you act etc… Keeping
             calm yourself will positively impact others opposed to what would happen if you lost your cool.
        </p>
        <p>
            Motivation: The drive to keep on trucking on no matter how hard it gets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Empathy: Is the ability to remove yourself and your personal opinions from a situation and put yourself in
             someone else’s shoes and see it from there point of view.
        </p>
        <p>
            Social Skills: The Ability to build rapport by communicating your point of view.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How is EI/EQ different to IQ
        </h3>
        <p>
            While EI as mentioned above relates to a persons ability to understand, control and use their emotions, a
             persons IQ (Intelligence Quotient) relates to that persons ability to reason and problem solve.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why is EI important to me and the world?
        </h3>
        <p>
            As I’ve already touched on the five components most people believe make up EI and how each of them is 
            beneficial in their own respect I will speak on EI as a whole. The world is a social place, there are 
            Billions of us and counting, and we can all communicate with each other. Because of this its unlikely you 
            will get that job you’ve always wanted or that girl of your dreams based on IQ alone. You need EI, and this 
            is because, simply, having a higher EI than the person next to you is going to make you a more likeable person
            9 times out of 10. Studies have also show that the higher up in leadership roles you go the more in demand 
            someone with a high EI is.
