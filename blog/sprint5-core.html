            What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I would still say this has remained the same as when I begun foundations. What I plan to do in the long term would probably be dependent on what parts of web development I really fall in love with, am thinking that could potentially be video game design or more backend type stuff but am more that ready to have my mind changed!

        <h3>
            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The strength the I really think is soing to help me the most for the upcoming bootcamp is my commitment to bettering myself. I know this is not the most flashy example of what I can do but I am more than ready to get stuck into bootcamp and make the most of the opportunity thtat I have in front of me. My biggest limitation and its really only something Ive noticed during the foudnations period is that im really not very good at asking for help. Be that as it may im really going to try and do better at this as I know that everyone at EDA is there to support me and want to see me do as well as I want to.

        <h3>
            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Honestly, I think it could be the workload. 60 hours a week sounds rather daunting and I think balancing all the work I am going to need to do whilst also maintaining a good sleep cycle, not dropping off the face of the earth and still exercising could prove a little difficult.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I want to hold myself accountable at all times. If im not doing what I need to be doing then I need to kick into gear and stop slacking as I know im not going to have the time. I also just want to do everything to the very best of my ability. Doesnâ€™t have to mean I put crazy hours into every little thing I do but I wan tto make sure that I am happy and really trying to take no board all the information and constructive critisismes that will come my way.
