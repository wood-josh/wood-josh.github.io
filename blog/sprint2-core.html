            <h3>
                What is your long-term goal and or career pathway?
            </h3>
                <p>
                    As of right now I’m not super sure about the long term. I would like to finish up EDA and 
                    probably get a role as a Jr Dev somewhere in Wellington, ideally, as I love this city. 
                    What I plan to do in the long term would probably be dependent on what parts of web 
                    development I really fall in love with, am thinking that could potentially be video game
                     design or more backend type stuff but am more that ready to have my mind changed!
                    </p>
            <h3>
                What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
            </h3>
                <p>
                    I think having my project management skills developed. And I’m not meaning in the sense of 
                    and actual project manager but more in the sense of figuring out where I need to start 
                    with this project in order to get to the result that I want. I tend to just kind of jump 
                    in a get stuck in with what I think could be a good place to start but often it impacts
                     my productivity which I think could be helpful if that was improved.
                    </p>
            <h3>
                A description of your own strengths and limitations and how you will manage the workload?
            </h3>
                <p>
                    I think my strengths would be my problem-solving ability, my work ethic and being 
                    personable. Limitations would be Time management. Because of these things I know that 
                    I need to be strict with myself from day dot of the course starting with putting a plan 
                    in place that I will stick to. I think working with team members will be great (as long 
                    as my jokes get some laughs), and just continue treating all staff the way I would like 
                    to be treated, with respect and patience.
                </p>
            <h3>
                A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
            </h3>
                <p>
                    I will firstly use the resources given to me, then I will take to the internet, then I 
                    will take to slack and utilize the channels I am apart of there, if I still haven’t found 
                    and answer to my problem I will get in touch with my facilitator. I also commit to not 
                    taking to long on problems where I do get stuck and this can sometimes be and issue of 
                    mine and I know I need all the time I can get and can always return back later once the 
                    rest of the day’s work is done.
                </p>
            <h3>
                A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
            </h3>
                <p>
                    During foundations I don’t expect a lot apart from someone being there if I do need any 
                    help with being talked through something I’m really stuck on. Encouragement always goes 
                    a long way as well!
                </p>
            <h3>
                Block out times
            </h3>
                <p>
                    I don’t really have any commitments that clash with when I’m expecting to be doing this 
                    course. The only one would be I pick my cousins up from school on a Wednesday at 3.15 and 
                    look after them until 6 but I plan to have the work I wanted done for the day done before 
                    I have to go out.
