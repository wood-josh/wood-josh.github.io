            Identity, Values and Strengths
        </h1>
        <p>
            Initially the core personal values I had written down for myself where honesty, fairness, humour, 
            self-control and intuition. Upon researching a little bit and finding this 
            (https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_85.htm) great process of identifying what your 
            core values are and in what order you value them, I came back with this list. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Honesty, Fairness, Self-Control, Consistency, Empathy, Independence, Intuition, Happiness, 
            Continuous Improvement, Humour, Diversity, Acceptance.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that these values and the way that I interact with the world are heavily influenced by my 
            pbringing and the environment that I grew up in. I am very fortunate to have grown up with the 
            amazingly loving and supportive parents that I did and have been told from day dot that if I’m happy 
            doing what I’m doing, they’ll be more than happy. I would say it’s by my parents influence that I 
            hold the values honesty, fairness, empathy, independence, happiness and humour in my top eleven 
            values. Most of these values, I feel, were implemented and instilled in me by my parents from as 
            early as I can remember and have developed and grown throughout my life alongside me.
        </p>
        <p>My schooling experience is also something that I think helped shape a lot of who I am today. At my 
            primary school I was one of five pakeha students (3 of the five being my brother, my sister and I), 
            in a predominantly Samoan school. Looking back on it now I never thought anything of it really, I 
            just went to school and made friends just as anyone would, resulting in rather ethnically diverse 
            gatherings for birthdays as my dad recalls. It was only once I got older that I realised this wasn’t 
            necessarily the norm, and I think is probably a major reason why I rank diversity and acceptance as 
            some of my most important values.
        </p>
        <p>An ethical decision is a decision that you make based of what you ethically believe is right or wrong/ 
            good or bad. What you would determine as ethically good or bad could be different to what someone else 
            would, and this is because each person’s personal values are different and what you consider important 
            may not be important at all to someone else. An example of an ethical decision I’ve had to make recently 
            is. Over the summer I was labouring to save money for while I was studying at EDA. This involved me 
            going out and about, door to door, asking if people needed help gardening, digging holes, cleaning 
            windows etc... My brother was also about to leave for Dunedin for his first year and hadn’t been 
            saving at all, so for jobs where I could use another set of hands, I would get him to help. Long 
            story short he ended up being quite unreliable to the point that my parents recommended that I pay 
            him $20 an hour while I take $30 to make up for the fact that he wasn’t going out looking for the 
            jobs and when I found one half the time he wouldn’t show up. Although I understood where they were 
            coming from, I personally found it unethical as I would have felt it was unfair to him to be paid 
            less for the work that he’s doing when it’s the same work that I’m doing. So, I continued to pay him 
            $25 along with myself. Whether that was the correct decision logically or not it was defiantly the 
            right ethical decision for me.
        </p>
        <p>I have done a couple of personality type tests before in the past but find that they are rather 
            inconsistent at giving me the same results. Weather that be a fault of my own with sitting on the 
            fence to much with a lot of the questions or me going into them with abit of a bias. That being said 
            every time I have done one, I have found myself able to resonate with bits and pieces, so here are my 
            results to the most recent 16personalities test I’ve done. Through reading over what the ISFP-A 
            strengths and weaknesses are I felt like I could relate somewhat with parts of what was said.
        </p>
        <p>Where I believe my strengths are in terms of this learning journey are my work ethic, my 
            problem-solving ability’s and how personable I am. I think work ethic is almost one of the most 
            important things you can have as it really determines how good of a job someone will do at the end 
            of the day. If someone is putting all their effort into something rather than slacking off even if 
            they don’t know as much as the slacker, I believe 9 times out of 10 the person that worked hard will 
            have gained more from the experience. I’ve always liked to tell myself my brain is problem solving 
            inclined weather that be the videos games I chose to play, the courses I took in school or just 
            generally most things in my life. If I’m not using my brain, I’m probably not enjoying myself as much 
            as I could be. This is really one of the reasons I am perusing web development as a career path 
            because I know I will always be thinking and always be able to improve what I know or learn something 
            new. Lastly, I think being a likeable, personable person will help in all aspects of life but on this 
            journey as a lot of what I will be doing will be team orientated. I think this will help reduce the 
            amount of head clashes people in groups with me will have and overall make the working environment 
            nicer to be in. You want to work with friends over foes any day of the week.
        </p>
        <p>Where I believe my limitations are would probably have to be time management and self-confidence. 
            Time management will be a big one as the first part of this course is done solely by yourself, on 
            your own time, when you want. To help make this less of an issue I’ve put times in place that I will 
            be doing work and taking breaks etc. and I plan to follow it everyday until the work I feel needs to 
            be done that day is done. Self-confidence is one that I am always trying to work on, I thin the only 
            way I could hinder me would again be in the foundations part of the course as I could get abit in my 
            head and down on myself with how I’m doing comparatively to everyone else in the class. To not make 
            this such an issue I just need to be ore self-assured that whatever pace I’m going at is great if I 
            am trying my hardest and putting in my full effort.
        </p>
        <p>The only time I’ve really every had struggles with group work was during one of my assignments in 
            university was a group project and one of the members that we got paired up with was a nightmare. 
            Would message a different excuse as to why he couldn’t meet up to work on the project, or why he 
            hadn’t done what he was supposed to do. After a couple of week, the reliable group member and I got 
            together and just did the parts that unreliable hadn’t done and handed in the assignment only a 
            couple of hours before it was due. Looking back on it now there were many ways I could have approached 
            the situation to potentially get him to do his part and I think the most obvious one would have just 
            been calling him on what he was doing. I like to think if I was put in this situation again I would act 
            like that and not the same way I did back then as it really was me just taking what he was saying at 
            face value and not realising he was actually just lazy.
