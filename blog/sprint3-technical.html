            HTML and CSS Analogy
        </h3>
        <p>
            Imagine the ocean and all the sand, fish, water and bottles that make it all up. HTML would be all of these things but without CSS, you wouldn’t be able to differentiate one of them from the pther. CSS styles the fish to look different from each other. Weather that be making the fish smaller, making it colourful like Nemo or able to live comfortably at the bottom of the ocean, making the glass bottles different shapes and colours, some are glass some are plastic. HTML gives us all the content on a webpage like the ocean but CSS Styles the content on the webpage.

            Control flow and Loops
        </h3>
        <p>
            My creative little explanation of control flow and loopsin real life is this. Say you live really close to the beach with your flatemates and the bunch of you are really keen surfers. The discussion you had the night before with everyone was if the weather was good and the swell was nice a couple of you would go together but if the swell wasn’t so nice the flatmates would sleep in until they had to get up for work. 
        </p>
        <div>
            <img class="solo-content-photo" src="images/controlFlowPhoto.PNG" alt="Photo of control flow">
        </div>
        <p>
            This is an example of a control flow. A control flow in web development is the order in which instructions are executed. In this example the return “Let’s get another hours sleep and stay toasty in bed” would only be displayed if the conditions (weather-good-swell-good) and (weather-good-swell-bad) are not met.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loops on the other hand are instructions that are repeated until that loops certain condition is met. There are 5 different kinds of loops used in JavaScript:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>for - loops through a block of code a number of times</li>
            <li>for/in - loops through the properties of an object</li>
            <li>for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object</li>
            <li>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
            <li>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However the loops I will be using most often are the for loops and the while loops.</p>
        <h3>
            The DOM
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming API for documents. What this means is that the DOM can display each and every part of a HTML document as an object (these objects are called nodes) and then because they are objects, JavaScript is able to interact with them. Here is a very simple example of the DOM as to not clutter up your screen too much but still give you an idea of what I’m talking about looks like.
        </p>
        <div>
            <img class="solo-content-photo" src="images/theDom.png" alt="Photo of the DOM">
        </div>
        <p>
            As you can see the DOM resembles a tree structure kind of like a family tree. In the DOM every element is a child, grandchild etc of the document object. Like the family tree each element can have any number of children the difference being of course that each element only has one parent.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Arrays and Objects
        </h3>
        <p>
            Both arrays and objects are considered special variables in JavaScript as they can contain multiple bits of information with the ability to add, remove or edit any of the info contained at any point. The difference being that arrays are used to store a list of items to a single variable and objects are used to represent something (animal, car, surfboard) that has characteristics. 
        </p>
        <div class="photos-next-together">
            <img class="two-content-photos" src="images/arrayDemo.png" alt="Photo of an array">
            <img class="two-content-photos" src="images/objectDemo.png" alt="Photo of a object">
        </div>
        <p>
            Above on the left is an example of an Array. It has a list of information about different dogs inside the variable dogBreeds. To access an array we use what is called zero-indexing, what this means is that each item listed in the array has a number value assigned to it, with the first item (Greyhound) being assigned a 0 the second item (Golden Retriever) is a 1 etc. As shown in the image above dogBreeds[3] calls upon Pitbull.
        </p>
        <p>
            The photo on the right is an example of an Object. It contains all the information about the characteristics of myDog these characteristics are called properties. To access an Object you must call the key for the property to display the correlated information. This can be done two different ways, using either dot notation or bracket notation as shown above.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Functions
        </h3>
        <p>
            A function is a piece of code that when called does something specific depending on what its instructions are. These instructions can be simple like subtracting numbers, or as complex as you could think of.  Below is a super simple example of a function that subtracts number a from number b.
        </p>
        <p>
            Functions are useful because they are reusable. They save you as a developer time by removing the need to keep repeating the same code over and over again unnecessarily.
